## Let's understand wallets.

There are two types of crypto wallets: __Hot__ and __Cold__ wallets. Just like your coffee.
Letâ€™s dive deep into them and understand how to use them efficiently.

ðŸ“Œ **_1. Hot_** Wallets are wallet that is connected to the internet regularly. They allow you to __store__, __send__, and __receive__ tokens. These wallets can be on your mobile and computer.  
Examples of hot wallets: __Electrum__, __MetaMask__, __Trust Wallet__.

__ðŸ‘‰ Advantages of Hot Wallets:__
- Easy to access
- Handy for daily transactions  

__ðŸ‘‰ Disadvantages of Hot Wallets:__  
- Always connected to the internet, thus can be hacked (stay SAFU).


ðŸ“Œ **_2. Cold_** Wallets on the other hand are __offline__ most of the time. You just need to use the public key if you are accepting crypto to your wallet. Even if the wallet is offline, the crypto gets deposited in your wallet address, can be verified on Blockchain explorer as well.  
Examples of cold wallets: __Ledger__ and __Trezor__.

__ðŸ‘‰ Advantages of Cold Wallets:__
- More secure  

__ðŸ‘‰ Disadvantages of Cold Wallets:__ 
 - Not very handy for daily transactions


Moral of the post: Use __both__ wallets. It's advisable to keep a huge chunk of your funds in the cold wallet as it's more secure.

ðŸ‘‰ These two wallets are similar to keeping money in your __bank__(Hot) vs __cash__(Cold)
